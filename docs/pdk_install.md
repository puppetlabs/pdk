# Installing PDK

Before you install Puppet Development Kit (PDK), make sure you meet the system
and language version requirements.

By default, PDK installs to the following locations:

-   On *nix and macOS systems: `/opt/puppetlabs/pdk/`

-   On Windows systems: `C:\Program Files\Puppet Labs\DevelopmentKit`


PDK uses the latest versions of Puppet 7 and 8 available at the time of release.
Modules created with PDK work with all Puppet and Ruby version combinations currently under maintenance.
See the [open source Puppet](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/about_agent.html) and
[Puppet Enterprise](https://www.puppet.com/docs/pe/2023.0/getting_support_for_pe.html#getting_support_for_pe) lifecycle pages for details.

PDK functions, such as creating classes, testing, and validation, are supported only on modules created or converted with PDK.

## Supported operating systems

PDK is compatible with *nix, Windows, and macOS systems. For detailed version compatibility, see the table below.

## Install PDK on macOS

To install PDK on macOS, download and install the package or install with
Homebrew.

By default, PDK installs to `/opt/puppetlabs/pdk/`.

### Install with Homebrew

Install and upgrade PDK with Homebrew, a package manager for macOS.

> **Before you begin**
> You must have Homebrew installed. See the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) page for
download and installation information.

If you've already installed PDK with the main Homebrew cask, see the topic about
migrating your PDK installation to the Puppet Homebrew cask.

1.  Install PDK by running `brew install --cask puppetlabs/puppet/pdk`

2.  Open a terminal to re-source your shell profile and make PDK available to
    your PATH.


#### What to do next:

To update PDK to the most recent release, run `brew upgrade --cask pdk`

### Migrate PDK installation to the Puppet Homebrew cask

If you previously installed PDK with the main Homebrew cask instead of the
Puppet cask, migrate your PDK installation to the Puppet cask.

> **Before you begin**
> If this is the first time you are installing PDK with Homebrew, see the topic
about installing PDK with Homebrew.

1.  Update Homebrew by running `brew update`

2.  Add the Puppet cask by running `brew tap puppetlabs/puppet`


#### What to do next:

To update PDK to the most recent release, run `brew upgrade --cask pdk`

### Download and install the package

Download and install the package for macOS systems.

1.  Download the package for your operating system from the PDK
    [download](https://puppet.com/download-puppet-development-kit) site.

2.  Double click on the downloaded package to install.

3.  Open a terminal to re-source your shell profile and make PDK available to
    your PATH.


## Install PDK on Windows

Download and install the PDK package for Windows systems, or install with
Chocolatey, a package manager for Windows.

By default, PDK installs into `C:\Program Files\Puppet Labs\DevelopmentKit`

### Install with Chocolatey

Install and upgrade PDK with Chocolatey, a package manager for Windows.

> **Before you begin**
> To install and upgrade PDK with the Chocolatey package manager for Windows, you
must have Chocolatey installed. See the [Chocolatey
documentation](https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation) for installation
instructions.

1.  Install PDK by running `choco install pdk`

2.  Open a new PowerShell window to re-source your profile and make PDK
    available to your PATH.

#### What to do next:

To upgrade PDK to the most recent release, run `choco upgrade pdk`

### Download and install the package

Download and install the PDK package for Windows systems.

1.  Download the package for your operating system from the PDK
    [download](https://puppet.com/download-puppet-development-kit) site.

2.  Double click on the downloaded package to install.

3.  Open a new PowerShell window to re-source your profile and make PDK
    available to your PATH.

## Setting up PDK behind a proxy

If you are using PDK behind a proxy, you must set environment variables to
enable PDK to communicate.

You can set these variables on the command line before each working session, or
you can add them to your system configuration, which varies depending on the
operating system.

On *nix or macOS systems, run:

```no-highlight
export http_proxy="http://user:password@proxy.domain.com:port"

export https_proxy="http://user:password@proxy.domain.com:port"

```

On Windows systems, run:

```no-highlight
$env:http_proxy="http://user:password@proxy.domain.com:port"

$env:https_proxy="http://user:password@proxy.domain.com:port"
```

## Setting up the PDK to connect to self-hosted git repositories

If after you've created a new module with the pdk, you want to download and test dependencies or "fixtures" from a self-hosted git repository, then you'll need to configure the pdk to trust this self-hosted site.  For more information, see [PDK Troubleshooting](pdk_troubleshooting.md#pdk-failing-to-pull-from-custom-git-server).
