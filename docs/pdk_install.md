# Installing PDK

Before you install Puppet Development Kit (PDK), make sure you meet the system
and language version requirements.

By default, PDK installs to the following locations:

-   On *nix and macOS systems: `/opt/puppetlabs/pdk/`

-   On Windows systems: `C:\Program Files\Puppet Labs\DevelopmentKit`


PDK uses Puppet 4 and later. Modules created with PDK work with all Puppet and
Ruby version combinations currently under maintenance. See [open source
Puppet](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/about_agent.html) and [Puppet
Enterprise](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2017.3/overview/getting_support_for_pe.html#supported-puppet-enterprise-versions)
lifecycle pages for details.

PDK functions, such as creating classes, testing, and validation, are supported
only on modules created or converted with PDK.

## Supported operating systems

PDK is compatible with *nix, Windows, and macOS systems. For detailed version
compatibility, see the table below.

|Operating system|Versions|Arch|Package type|
|----------------|--------|----|------------|
|CentOS|6, 7, 8|x86_64|RPM|
|Debian|8, 9, 10|x86_64|DEB|
|Fedora|28, 29, 30|x86_64|RPM|
|macOS|10.11, 10.12, 10.13, 10.14|x86_64|DPKG|
|Oracle Linux|6, 7, 8|x86_64|RPM|

```

## Install PDK on macOS

To install PDK on macOS, download and install the package or install with
Homebrew.

By default, PDK installs to `/opt/puppetlabs/pdk/`.

### Install with Homebrew

Install and upgrade PDK with Homebrew, a package manager for macOS.

> **Before you begin**
> You must have Homebrew installed. See the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) page for
download and installation information.

If you've already installed PDK with the main Homebrew cask, see the topic about
migrating your PDK installation to the Puppet Homebrew cask.

1.  Install PDK by running `brew cask install puppetlabs/puppet/pdk`

2.  Open a terminal to re-source your shell profile and make PDK available to
    your PATH.Â 


#### What to do next:

To update PDK to the most recent release, run `brew cask upgrade pdk`

### Migrate PDK installation to the Puppet Homebrew cask

If you previously installed PDK with the main Homebrew cask instead of the
Puppet cask, migrate your PDK installation to the Puppet cask.

> **Before you begin**
> If this is the first time you are installing PDK with Homebrew, see the topic
about installing PDK with Homebrew.

1.  Update Homebrew by running `brew update`

2.  Add the Puppet cask by running `brew tap puppetlabs/puppet`


#### What to do next:

To update PDK to the most recent release, run `brew cask upgrade pdk`

### Download and install the package

Download and install the package for macOS systems.

1.  Download the package for your operating system from the PDK
    [download](https://puppet.com/download-puppet-development-kit) site.

2.  Double click on the downloaded package to install.

3.  Open a terminal to re-source your shell profile and make PDK available to
    your PATH.


## Install PDK on Windows

Download and install the PDK package for Windows systems, or install with
Chocolatey, a package manager for Windows.

By default, PDK installs into `C:\Program Files\Puppet Labs\DevelopmentKit`

### Install with Chocolatey

Install and upgrade PDK with Chocolatey, a package manager for Windows.

> **Before you begin**
> To install and upgrade PDK with the Chocolatey package manager for Windows, you
must have Chocolatey installed. See the [Chocolatey
documentation](https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation) for installation
instructions.

1.  Install PDK by running `choco install pdk`

2.  Open a new PowerShell window to re-source your profile and make PDK
    available to your PATH.


**Result:**

On PowerShell 4.0 or later, PDK loads automatically and `pdk` commands are
available to the prompt. On PowerShell 2.0 or 3.0, you'll need to add the
PowerShell module to your profile.

> **Tip:** If you encounter execution policy restriction errors when you try to
run `pdk` commands, see [troubleshooting](pdk_troubleshooting.md) for help.

#### What to do next:

To upgrade PDK to the most recent release, run `choco upgrade pdk`

### Download and install the package

Download and install the PDK package for Windows systems.

1.  Download the package for your operating system from the PDK
    [download](https://puppet.com/download-puppet-development-kit) site.

2.  Double click on the downloaded package to install.

3.  Open a new PowerShell window to re-source your profile and make PDK
    available to your PATH.


**Result:**

On PowerShell 4.0 or later, PDK loads automatically and `pdk` commands are
available to the prompt. On PowerShell 2.0 or 3.0, you'll need to add the
PowerShell module to your profile.

> **Tip:** If you encounter execution policy restriction errors when you try to
run `pdk` commands, see [troubleshooting](pdk_troubleshooting.md) for help.

### Add the PDK module to PowerShell

PowerShell versions 2.0 and 3.0 cannot automatically discover and load the PDK
module, so you'll need to add it manually.

To allow PowerShell to load PDK, add the module to your PowerShell profile.

1.  Add the following line to your PowerShell profile:

    ```
    `Import-Module -Name "$($env:ProgramFiles)\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\PuppetDevelopmentKit"`
    ```

2.  Close and re-open the PowerShell window to re-source your profile.


**Result:**

PDK will now automatically load every time you open PowerShell.

## Setting up PDK behind a proxy

If you are using PDK behind a proxy, you must set environment variables to
enable PDK to communicate.

You can set these variables on the command line before each working session, or
you can add them to your system configuration, which varies depending on the
operating system.

On *nix or macOS systems, run:

```no-highlight
export http_proxy="http://user:password@proxy.domain.com:port"

export https_proxy="http://user:password@proxy.domain.com:port"

```

On Windows systems, run:

```no-highlight
$env:http_proxy="http://user:password@proxy.domain.com:port"

$env:https_proxy="http://user:password@proxy.domain.com:port"
```

## Analytics

### PDK data collection

PDK collects usage data to help us understand how it's being used and how we can
improve it. You can opt out of data collection at any time; see the section
below about opting out.

We collect these values for every analytics event:

-   A random non-identifying user ID. This ID is shared with Bolt analytics, if
    you've installed Bolt and enabled analytics.
-   PDK installation method (`package` or `gem`).
-   Version of PDK.
-   Operating system and version.

For every successful command line invocation of PDK, we collect:

-   The PDK command executed, such as `pdk new module` or ``pdk validate``.
-   Anonymised command options and arguments.
-   The version of Ruby used to execute the command.
-   The output formats for the command.
-   `PDK_*` environment variables and their values, if set.
-   Whether a template repository, if used, is `default` or `custom` â we do not
    record the path to the template repo itself.
-   If the default template repo is used, we collect events for each file
    rendered, recording whether the file is `unmanaged`, `deleted`,
    `customized`, or `default`. For customized files, we do not record what
    changed, only that it was changed in the `.sync.yml` file.

> **Note:** All arguments and non-Boolean option values, except `--puppet-version`
and `--pe-version` are redacted in our collected data.

Invalid commands are submitted as a distinct analytics events with the arguments
and option values redacted.

To see the data PDK collects, add the `--debug` option to any `pdk` command. We
test the analytics calls strictly to ensure that no unexpected data is
accidentally passed in.

### Opting out of PDK data collection

The first time you run PDK, it asks you if you want to opt out of data
collection. To opt out of data collection after that, edit the `analytics.yml`
file, setting the `disabled` key to `true`.

```
disabled: true
```

The location of this configuration file depends on your operating system and
configuration:

-   For most \*nix systems, where the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` variable is set:
    `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/puppet/analytics.yml`.
-   For most macOS systems, where the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` variable is not set:
    `~/.config/puppet/analytics.yml`.
-   For Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/puppet/analytics.yml`.

You can also opt out of analytics by setting the environment variable
`PDK_DISABLE_ANALYTICS=true`. This is useful if you are using PDK in your CI
system.
